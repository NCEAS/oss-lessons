# Data Visualization

## Dataviz and Interactive Tools

We're going to learn how to make a variety of static and interactive plots in R.
Visualizing data is an essential skill in science and knowing at least one tool well will serve you in the future.
For static graphics, I prefer and recommend ggplot2.
For interactive graphics, I'd like to introduce you to Shiny.

These two packages will be taught in their own submodules:

- [ggplot2](./module-1-ggplot2.html)
- [Shiny](./module-2-shiny.html)

And if we have time I want to introduce some really awesome R packages:

- [Trelliscope](http://deltarho.org/) (explore data quick)
- [htmlwidgets](http://www.htmlwidgets.org/) (advanced visualizations)
    - Example: [https://github.com/amoeba/bristol_bay_permit_viz](https://github.com/amoeba/bristol_bay_permit_viz)
- [plotly](https://plot.ly/r/) (easy interactive plots)
- [dygraph](https://rstudio.github.io/dygraphs/) (easy interactive timeseries plots)

### Learning outcomes

After completing this module, students should:

- Be able to make simple to intermediate plots in R using ggplot2
- Be able to a simple Shiny app
- Have an increased awareness of plotting options in R

and students should have an awareness of the great number of visualization tools provided in R and what they're useful for.

## Introduction to ggplot2

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(rgdal)
library(dplyr)
library(viridis)
library(broom)
library(dplyr)
```

### Overview

ggplot2 is a popular package for visualizing data in R.

From the [home page](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/):

> ggplot2 is a system for declaratively creating graphics, based on The Grammar of Graphics. You provide the data, tell ggplot2 how to map variables to aesthetics, what graphical primitives to use, and it takes care of the details.

It's been around for years and has pretty good documentation and tons of example code around the web (like on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ggplot2)).
This lesson will introduce you to the basic components of working with ggplot2.

### Lesson

#### ggplot vs base vs lattice vs XYZ...

R provides **many** ways to get your data into a plot.
Three common ones are,

- "base graphics" (`plot`, `hist`, etc`)
- lattice
- ggplot2

All of them work!
I use base graphics for simple, quick and dirty plots.
I use ggplot2 for most everything else.

ggplot2 excels at making complicated plots easy and easy plots simple enough.

#### Geoms / Aesthetics

Every graphic you make in ggplot2 will have at least one aesthetic and at least one geom (layer).
The aesthetic maps your data to your geometry (layer).
Your geometry specifies the type of plot we're making (point, bar, etc.).

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) + 
  geom_point()
```

What makes ggplot really powerful is how quickly we can make this plot visualize more aspects of our data. Coloring each point by class (compact, van, pickup, etc.) is just a quick extra bit of code:

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, color = class)) +
  geom_point()
```

Aside: How did I know to write `color = class`?
`aes` will pass its arguments on to any geoms you use and we can find out what aesthetic mappings geom_point takes with `?geom_point` (see section "Aesthetics")

Challenge: Find another aesthetic mapping `geom_point` can take and add add it to the plot.

What if we just wanted the color of the points to be blue?
Maybe we'd do this:

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, color = "blue")) +
  geom_point()
```

Well that's weird -- why are the points red?

What happened here?
This is the difference between **setting** and **mapping** in ggplot.
The `aes` function **only** takes mappings from our data onto our geom.
If we want to make all the points blue, we need to **set** it inside the geom:

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue")
```

**Challenge:** Using the aesthetic you discovered and tried above, **set** another aesthetic onto our points.

Sizing each point by the number of cylinders is easy:

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, color = class, size = cyl)) +
  geom_point()
```

So it's clear we can make scatter and bubble plots.
What other kinds of plots can we make? (Hint: Tons)

Let's make a histogram:

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(hwy)) + 
  geom_histogram()
```

You'll see with a warning (red text):

> `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.

ggplot2 can calculate statistics on our data such as frequencies and, in this case, it's doing that on our `hwy` column with the `stat_bin` function.
Binning data requires choosing a bin size and the choice of bin size can completely change our histogram (often resulting in misleading conclusions).
We should change the `bins` argument in this case to 1 because we don't want to hide any of our frequencies:

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(hwy)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)
```

**Challenge:** Find an aesthetic `geom_histogram` supports and try it out.

I'm a big fan of box plots and ggplot2 can plot these too:

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(cyl, hwy)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```

Oops, we got an error:

> Warning message:
> Continuous x aesthetic -- did you forget aes(group=...)? 

That's because we need to convert `cyl` to a factor:

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(factor(cyl), hwy)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```

Another type of visualization I use a lot for seeing my distributions is the violin plot:

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(factor(class), hwy)) + geom_violin()
```

So far we've made really simple plots: One geometry per plot.
Let's layer multiple geometries on top of one another to show the raw points on top of the violins:

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(factor(class), hwy)) + 
  geom_violin() +
  geom_point(shape = 1, position = "jitter")
```

Some geoms can do even more than just show us our data.
ggplot2 also helps us do some quick-and-dirty modeling:

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(cty, hwy)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
```

Notice the mesage in red text

> `geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess'

geom_smooth defaulted here to using a LOESS smoother.
But `geom_smooth()` is pretty configurable.
Here we set the method to `lm` instead of the default `loess`:

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(cty, hwy)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

More on geoms here: http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html#section-layer-geoms

#### Setting plot limits

Plot limits can be controlled one of three ways:

- Filter the data (because limits are auto-calculated from the data ranges)
- Set the `limits` argument on one or both scales
- Set the `xlim` and `ylim` arguments in `coord_cartesian()`

Let's show this with an example plot:

```{r}
ggplot(economics, aes(date, unemploy)) + 
  geom_line()
```

Since we're plotting data where the zero point on the vertical axis means something, maybe we want to start the vertical axis at 0:

```{r}
ggplot(economics, aes(date, unemploy)) + 
  geom_line() +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, max(economics$unemploy)))
```

Or maybe we want to zoom in on just the 2000's and beyond:

```{r}
ggplot(economics, aes(date, unemploy)) + 
  geom_line() +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, max(economics$unemploy))) +
  scale_x_date(limits = c(as.Date("2000-01-01"), as.Date(Sys.time())))
```

Note the warning message we received:

> Warning message:
> Removed 390 rows containing missing values (geom_path). 

That's normal when data in your input data.frame are outside the range we're plotting.

Let's use `coord_cartesian` instead to change the x and y limits:

```{r}
ggplot(economics, aes(date, unemploy)) + 
  geom_line() +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(as.Date("2000-01-01"), as.Date(Sys.time())),
                  ylim = c(0, max(economics$unemploy)))
```

Note the **slight* difference when using `coord_cartesian`: ggplot didn't put a buffer around our values.
Sometimes we want this and sometimes we don't and it's good to know this difference.

#### Scales

The usual use case is to do things like changing scale limits or change the **way** our data are mapped onto our geom.
We'll use scales in ggplot2 very often!

For example, how do we override the default colors ggplot2 uses here?

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, color = class)) +
  geom_point()
```

**Tip:** Most scales follow the format `scale_{aesthetic}_{method} where aesthetic are our aesthetic mappings such as color, fill, shape and method is how the colors, fill colors, and shapes are chosen.

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, color = class)) +
  geom_point() + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c("red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "purple", "violet")) # ROYGBIV
```

I'm sure that was a ton of fun to type out but we can make things easier on ourselves:

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, color = class)) +
  geom_point() + 
  scale_color_hue(h = c(270, 360)) # blue to red
```

Above we were using scales to scale the `color` aesthetic.
We can also use scales to rescale our data.
Here's some census data, unscaled:

```{r}
ggplot(midwest, aes(area, poptotal)) + 
  geom_point()
```

And scaled (log10):

```{r}
ggplot(midwest, aes(area, poptotal)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  scale_y_log10()
```

Scales can also be used to change our axes.
For example, we can override the labels:

```{r}
mpg %>%
  group_by(class) %>% 
  summarize(maxhwy = max(hwy)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(class, maxhwy)) +
    geom_col() +
    scale_x_discrete(labels = toupper(sort(unique(mpg$manufacturer))))
```

Or change the breaks:

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) + 
  geom_point() +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(min(mpg$hwy), max(mpg$hwy)))
```

### Facets

Facets allow us to create a powerful visualization called a small multiple:

http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-g-california-drought-map-htmlstory.html

I use small multiples all the time when I have a variable like a site or year and I want to quickly compare across years. Let's compare highway fuel economy versus engine displacement across our two samples:

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ year)
```

Or fuel economy versus engine displacement across manufacturer:

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ manufacturer)
```

#### Plot customization

ggplot2 offers us a very highly level of customizability in, what I think, is a fairly easy to discover and remember way with the `theme` function and pre-set themes.

ggplot2 comes with a set of themes which are a quick way to get a different look to your plots.
Let's use another theme than the default:

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, color = class)) + 
  geom_point() +
  theme_classic()
```

**Challenge:** Find another theme and use it instead

The legend in ggplot2 is a thematic element.
Let's change the way the legend displays:

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, color = class)) + 
  geom_point() +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        legend.background = element_rect(fill = "#EEEEEE", color = "black"),
        legend.title = element_blank(),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 16))
```

Let's adjust our axis labels and title:

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, color = class)) + 
  geom_point() +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(legend.position = c(1, 1),
        legend.justification = c(1,1),
        legend.direction = "horizontal",
        legend.title = element_blank()) +
  xlab("Engine Displacement") +
  ylab("Highway Fuel Economy (miles / gallon") +
  ggtitle("Highway fuel economy versus engine displacement",
          "or why do you need that big truck again? ")
```

**Challenge:** Look at the help for ?theme and try changing something else about the above plot.

More themes are available in a user-contributed package called [ggthemes]( https://github.com/jrnold/ggthemes).

#### Saving plots

Let's save that great plot we just made.
Saving plots in ggplot is done with the `ggsave()` function:

```{r}
ggsave("hwy_vs_displ.png")
```

`ggsave` automatically chooses the format based on your file extension and guesses a default image size.
We can customize the size with the `width` and `height` arguments:

```{r}
ggsave("hwy_vs_displ.png", width = 6, height = 6)
```

### Maps with ggplot2

ggplot2 plots data.frames so if we turn our shapefiles (or rasters!) into data.frames, we can plot them in ggplot2 just like before:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Change this if needed
census <- readOGR("./data/cb_2016_us_state_20m.shp")

census$id <- rownames(census@data)
census_f <- tidy(census, region = "id")
census_f <- left_join(census_f, census@data, by = "id")

ggplot(census_f, aes(long, lat, fill = ALAND, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon() +
  scale_fill_viridis() +
  coord_cartesian(c(-180, -60)) +
  theme_classic()
```

**Challenge:** Reproject the data before plotting

## Introduction to Shiny

Shiny is an R package for creating interactive data visualization explorations that you and your colleagues can visit in their web browser without installing anything.
The convenience this affords is priceless when we want to share and let others explore our data and analyses.

There are some really great examples of what Shiny can do on their webite like [this one](http://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/movie-explorer.html).

### Lesson

We're going to create a simple shiny app with two sliders so we can interactively control inputs to an R function.
This extends our work done earlier in this course so we're going to start where we left off with our inverse distance weighting exercise and turn the static plot we made at the end into an interactive graphic.

Steps:

- Get students to reorient themselves to the data from tuesday

    Link is https://figshare.com/articles/OSS_data_-_2017_monday/5136289
- File > New > Shiny Web App...
- Set some fields:
    ![creating a new Shiny app with RStudio](images/shiny-new-app.png)
    
    - Name it "myapp" or something else
    - Select "Single File"
    - Choose to create it where we were working yesterday:
        e.g. setwd("~/Documents/oss/oss2017data") 
        or whereever you were working
    - Click Create
- Run through the steps we can use to create what's in [./idw_app.R](./idw_app.R)
